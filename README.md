# Garmin_Project
Utilized Python for data processing and employed MATPLOTLIB for graphical representation, generating informative graphs to track running progress. Presented findings to the end-user, providing valuable insights into the correlation between training volume and marathon performance. Discovered a significant pattern: the week of his marathon personal best aligned with a month where he consistently ran 150 miles, while the slowest marathon correlated with a month where he ran 50 miles.
